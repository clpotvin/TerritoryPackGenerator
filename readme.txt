        Territory Pack Generator Instructions
|---------------------------------------------------|

1. Go into BaseTextures and replace any textures you might want to replace
     - Note: All textures (except HQ) must be 32x PNG files with a Bit Depth of 32.
	- To check Bit Depth, open the properties of an image and find Bit Depth
	in the details tab. 
	- If you need to change the Bit Depth, find instructions at the bottom of
	this file.
2. Open main .py in PyCharm.
     - Hopefully it will work out of the box since I included the venv, otherwise you
     will need to setup a venv.
3. Run the script.
4. When asked to input your guild tag, input the 3 or 4 letter tag of your guild.
5. When asked to input your HQ location, input the name of the territory that your
    hq will be located on, make sure it is capitalized how it is in-game, as I was too
    lazy to make it accept improper capitalization.
6. The territory pack should be generated, now just copy it into you resource packs.
